# Fab Lab reservation system

Most reservation systems handle one parameter. This system was designed to be able to handle availability of the equipment and the staff before allowing a reservation. This is handled by a point system with reservation type fully configurable without hardcode. The deploy method was Docker. 

This project is here only for portfolio reason and was finished coded in 2021. If somehow you want to use it, the dependencies will need to be updated. A basic Django's .env file will need to be added.
